For testing purposes, the tetris blocks will fall based on the numbers in a text file containing random numbers from 0 to 6.

Initial testings may only call for the first 10 or 100 blocks to reduce memory allocation and runtime processes therefore lists 
contain an appropriate number of numbers.

# 0 = blockI
# 1 = blockO
# 2 = blockT
# 3 = blockJ
# 4 = blockL
# 5 = blockS
# 6 = blockZ

SameOrder:

Used to test the same neural network. If 10 blocks can be cleared successfully, 100 will be implemented.

DifferentOrder:

Used for the final stage of the project where random blocks are initialized and dropped.
